              <p>We’re all taught from an early age that any healthy lifestyle should include regular exercise. More
                specifically, the NHS recommends that adults aim for 150 minutes of physical activity a week, which is
                only around 22 minutes per day. However, bear in mind that consistency is key. Tap to read more.</p>

              <p>Exercise provides a remarkable variety of health benefits, which range from strengthening bones to
                positive effects on mood and helping to prevent chronic illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease.
                Research dating back to the late 1980s has consistently shown that aerobic fitness may help extend

              <p>You know you should exercise, but that gym membership you’ve been thinking about hasn’t yet
                materialized. Maybe you’re not quite ready to venture outside to run or walk in public. The good news?
                You can get a full-body workout in the comfort and privacy of home—and it won’t cost you a dime.</p>

              <h2>How To Build A Healthy Cheese Board</h2>
              <p>I love a good cheese plate. It’s my go-to starter for dinner parties and few weekends go by without an
                epic snack plate, even if it’s just for two. However, just like everything else, you can have too much
                of a good thing and there’s nothing worse than feeling uncomfortable full before the main course even
                hits the table.</p>

              <h2>The Best Game Ever Invented</h2>
              <p>On a recent trip to Europe my brothers and I invented a new game called "Pool Cue Jenga". It is the
                best game ever invented.</p>
              <p>The rules are simple: You must use a pool cue to remove tiles. Only one cue can be used, and you can
                not use your fingers.</p>
